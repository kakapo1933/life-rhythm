# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a personal task and event tracking desktop application. The application will be built using Tauri with a React/TypeScript frontend, providing users with a native desktop experience for managing their tasks and tracking recurring events. The initial phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation with proper project structure, build configuration, and basic application shell that will support future development of comprehensive task management and event tracking features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a Tauri project with React/TypeScript in the current directory, so that I have a proper desktop application foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize the project THEN the system SHALL set up Tauri project structure with React/TypeScript frontend in the current directory
2. WHEN I build the project THEN the system SHALL compile successfully without errors
3. WHEN I run the development server THEN the system SHALL launch both the Tauri backend and React frontend
4. WHEN I package the application THEN the system SHALL create a distributable desktop application
5. WHEN I open the packaged app THEN the system SHALL display a functional desktop window

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized folder structure with documentation, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the project structure THEN the system SHALL separate frontend and backend concerns clearly
2. WHEN I look at the src directory THEN the system SHALL organize components, hooks, types, utilities, and tests in separate folders
3. WHEN I review the Tauri configuration THEN the system SHALL have proper src-tauri directory structure with main.rs and tauri.conf.json
4. WHEN I check the build configuration THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript, Vite, and Tauri build settings
5. WHEN I look at the docs folder THEN the system SHALL contain project documentation including setup instructions and architecture overview
6. WHEN I add new features THEN the system SHALL support the established folder conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want essential development dependencies configured with pnpm, so that I can use modern React patterns and TypeScript effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check package.json THEN the system SHALL include React 19+, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS as core dependencies managed by pnpm
2. WHEN I install dependencies THEN the system SHALL use pnpm as the package manager with pnpm-lock.yaml
3. WHEN I write TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL provide proper type checking and IntelliSense support
4. WHEN I use React hooks THEN the system SHALL support modern React patterns and state management
5. WHEN I import modules THEN the system SHALL resolve paths correctly with proper TypeScript configuration
6. WHEN I run linting THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent code style and catch common errors
7. WHEN I format code THEN the system SHALL automatically format files using Prettier with consistent styling rules


### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic application shell with routing and Tailwind CSS, so that I can add different views and navigation later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the application THEN the system SHALL display a main application window with basic layout
2. WHEN I set up routing THEN the system SHALL support navigation between different views
3. WHEN I create components THEN the system SHALL follow React functional component patterns with TypeScript
4. WHEN I add new routes THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing routing structure
5. WHEN I style components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Tauri-specific configurations set up, so that the desktop application behaves correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure the Tauri app THEN the system SHALL set appropriate window properties (size, title, icon)
2. WHEN I build for different platforms THEN the system SHALL support cross-platform compilation
3. WHEN I access system APIs THEN the system SHALL have proper Tauri command structure in place
4. WHEN I handle file operations THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate Tauri permissions
5. WHEN I test the app THEN the system SHALL provide both development and production build modes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive project documentation, so that the project is well-documented and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check the docs folder THEN the system SHALL include a README.md with project overview and setup instructions
2. WHEN I review documentation THEN the system SHALL include architecture documentation explaining the Tauri + React structure
3. WHEN I look at development docs THEN the system SHALL include development workflow and build process documentation
4. WHEN I check API documentation THEN the system SHALL include documentation for any Tauri commands and interfaces
5. WHEN I update features THEN the system SHALL maintain up-to-date documentation alongside code changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want local data storage configured, so that the application can persist tasks and events locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set up data storage THEN the system SHALL configure SQLite database for local data persistence
2. WHEN I initialize the database THEN the system SHALL create appropriate tables for tasks and events
3. WHEN I access the database THEN the system SHALL use Tauri's database plugin or similar for secure database operations
4. WHEN I store data THEN the system SHALL save user data in the application's local data directory
5. WHEN I query data THEN the system SHALL provide efficient read/write operations for task and event management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want git version control initialized in the current directory, so that I can track changes and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize git THEN the system SHALL create a git repository in the current directory with initial commit
2. WHEN I check git status THEN the system SHALL have appropriate .gitignore file excluding build artifacts and dependencies
3. WHEN I commit changes THEN the system SHALL track source code files while ignoring generated content
4. WHEN I review the repository THEN the system SHALL include proper commit messages following conventional commit format
5. WHEN I set up the project THEN the system SHALL be ready for remote repository connection and collaboration
