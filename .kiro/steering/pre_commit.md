# Git Commits

- **Always update documentation before committing to git**: Ensure all README files, API docs, and inline comments reflect current functionality.
- **Always summarize changes for new commits**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why.
- **Follow commit convention**: Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description where type is feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/test/chore.
- **Review code for security**: Check for potential vulnerabilities, especially when handling user input or external APIs.
- **Run tests before committing**: Verify all existing functionality still works and new features are properly tested.
